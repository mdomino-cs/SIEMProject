Azure Home SOC

This project is a mini Home SOC built in Azure. I deployed a VM, opened its firewall to attract real internet traffic, and forwarded all security logs into a SIEM. The SIEM ingests and analyzes the events, then displays them on a live attack map showing where attacks originate and how often they occur. This setup demonstrates basic log aggregation, monitoring, and threat visibility in a cloud environment.
